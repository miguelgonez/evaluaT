The previous AI engineer successfully developed a SaaS platform for AI compliance, from initial self-assessment to a robust Knowledge Augmented Generation (RAG) system. This involved integrating document management, an intelligent LLM-powered chat, news, and a timeline. Significant work was done to resolve a pervasive  variable declaration conflict across the React frontend, which initially led to an accidental simplification of the entire application. This was corrected by systematically renaming variables. The engineer then focused on implementing a new Admin Panel with scheduled updates and a document Repository, enhancing the chat by removing markdown and integrating ISO standards. Recent efforts included making landing page statistics dynamic, implementing a PDF report generator, and troubleshooting persistent sidebar navigation issues, which were initially reported as fixed by a testing agent but still showed intermittent problems. The latest task involves creating an interactive demo based on the Caso Alzherm-IA document, with new VESOS-related services and UI components.

<product_requirements>
The user requires a SaaS platform for AI compliance self-evaluation, tailored for digital health and insurtech startups in Spain. The application features include:
1.  **Self-evaluation:** Initial AI compliance assessment generating recommendations in Spanish.
2.  **Knowledge Augmented Generation (RAG) System:** Extracts and utilizes information from normative sources, including automatic updates of documents (MDR, GDPR, EU AI Act, etc.), ISO standards (13485, 14971, 27001, etc.), and new documents like ICU-VESOS and Project FENIX.
3.  **User Interface:** A React frontend with a Streamlit-like sidebar menu for navigation, including Autoevaluación, Chat Inteligente, Noticias, Documentos, Cronograma, Artículos Técnicos, Repositorio, and Análisis VESOS. Shadcn UI components and Tailwind CSS for a modern design.
4.  **Intelligent Chat:** RAG-based chat using LLMs (GPT-4o-mini via Emergent LLM key) and ChromaDB, providing context-aware responses without markdown formatting.
5.  **News Section:** Displays real-time regulatory news from official sources, with filters.
6.  **Cronograma (Timeline) Section:** Displays upcoming milestones (conferences, regulatory effective dates).
7.  **Technical Articles Section:** Dedicated section for real, verified content.
8.  **Admin Panel:** A separate route () for maintenance with specific credentials (User: Admin, Pass: Logo.202000%), enabling daily automatic updates of documents, news, articles, and RAG integration.
9.  **Repository Section:** Displays documents with metadata, links, and LLM-generated Spanish summaries from a SQLite database, with search and filter options.
10. **Dynamic Statistics:** Landing page displays real-time statistics (e.g., Startups Evaluadas, Precisión).
11. **Demo Mode:** A demonstration mode accessible from the landing page, bypassing authentication to showcase core functionalities, including a new interactive demo for Caso Alzherm-IA.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-Stack Development:** React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (main DB), SQLite (metadata for repository).
-   **Knowledge Augmented Generation (RAG):** LangChain, ChromaDB for document vectorization/retrieval.
-   **LLMs:** OpenAI GPT-4o-mini (via Emergent LLM key) for chat and content generation.
-   **UI/UX:** Shadcn UI components, Tailwind CSS.
-   **Authentication:** JWT-based.
-   **Data Management:** Web scraping for news/documents, scheduler for automatic updates,  for React state management.

<code_architecture>


-   ****: The core backend file, integrating authentication, chat, document management, news, timeline, and now **admin and ICU-VESOS APIs**. It has been updated to include routes for , , and a public endpoint () for landing page data. It also initializes the  scheduler on startup.
-   ****: Manages document scraping, processing, embedding, and storage in ChromaDB.
-   ****: Encapsulates LLM chat logic. Modified to include ISO standards knowledge in its system message and a  function to remove markdown characters from LLM outputs.
-   ** (New)**: Central for administration. Manages daily automatic updates (documents, news, articles, ISO standards), and stores document metadata in a SQLite database. Includes functions to fetch ISO standards.
-   ** (New)**: Implements the ICU-VESOS framework and Project FENIX logic, with API endpoints for analysis and fetching results.
-   ****: The primary frontend file. It defines routing, authentication context, and renders various pages/components. It underwent extensive modifications:
    -   **Fixed  conflicts**: All  state variables were renamed to component-specific names (e.g., , ).
    -   **Sidebar navigation**: Added new sections (Repositorio, Análisis VESOS) and implemented  for  to address stale closure issues, improving navigation.
    -   **Demo Mode**: Added logic to  and other components to function without full authentication for the  route, simulating data.
    -   **Dynamic Stats**: Fetches data from  for the landing page.
    -   **Report Generation**: Integrated a  function to replace a placeholder alert.
    -   **Icon Imports**: Added  icon for the Repositorio section.
-   ** (New)**: Frontend component for the administration dashboard.
-   ** (New)**: Frontend component being developed for the interactive Alzherm-IA demo.
-   ****: Modified to temporarily disable ESLint to bypass parsing errors during compilation.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the implementation of the interactive Caso Alzherm-IA demo, including necessary UI components like .
-   Thoroughly re-verify and fix any remaining specific-case issues with sidebar navigation, as intermittent problems were reported even after the general fix.
-   Ensure automatic updates are consistently working, as the previous fix for  initialization was a first attempt.
-   Implement the frontend functionality for the Admin Panel to trigger manual updates and display system logs/statistics.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on integrating the Caso Alzherm-IA as an interactive demo into the application. This specific task involves:

1.  **Document Analysis**: Extracted detailed information from the uploaded Caso_Alzherm-IA_ICU-VESOS_GoogleDocs.docx.
2.  **Backend Integration**: The ICU-VESOS framework and Project FENIX logic were integrated into the backend via  and  updates, including new API endpoints.
3.  **Frontend Component Creation**: Created  to house the interactive demo.
4.  **UI Integration**: Added a new Análisis VESOS section to the frontend, including it in the sidebar menu and as a quick action button on the dashboard.
5.  **Ongoing Development**: The engineer is currently in the process of adding the  component, which is required for the  functionality, indicating that the demo component itself is still under active construction.

A recurring issue of sidebar navigation preventing content from changing when Análisis VESOS (and previously Documentos, Repositorio) is clicked was observed again, despite a reported fix by the frontend testing agent earlier in the trajectory. This indicates that the navigation might be fixed for some cases but not universally, or that a new integration introduced a regression.

<optional_next_step>
Continue implementing the  component and complete the  component for the interactive demo.
